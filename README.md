**Problem Statement :** Company X is a local telecom company and is facing a decline in profits over the past few
years. BCG has been engaged to drive improvements in profitability. One of the hypotheses
under consideration is the introduction of handset leasing.
Handset leasing works by renting new phones to customers for a monthly fee instead of selling
phones to customers at a discounted upfront cost. Customers lease phones for a fixed term
(usually 12 months), before they swap their used phone for a new model. Some telecom
companies bundle phone leasing plans with lower-priced sim-only mobile plans. This allows
customers to change their phones more frequently without incurring upfront costs of buying
phones through retail or affecting their mobile plans. For the telcos, this reduces their need to
hold inventory and reduces their financing costs, both of which can help profitability.
The Principal, Elisse, held an initial team meeting to discuss the various initiatives, including
handset leasing. After a discussion with your team, you have identified the need to do some
market research and find out the impact of handset leasing on telco profitability in other
markets.
